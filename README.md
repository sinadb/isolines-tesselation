# isolines-tesselation
Metal has no isoline tesselation feature unlike openGL so I was interested in implementing a basic demo using compute shaders. This demo demonstrates linear,
second and third degree bezier curve tesselations. Each tesselation mode can also be configured to have up to 2 extra control points to interpolate the
isoline "vertically"
